# t-SNE

t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) is a non-linear technique for dimensionality reduction that is particularly well suited for the visualization of high-dimensional datasets. It is extensively applied in image processing, NLP, genomic data and speech processing. To keep things simple, hereâ€™s a brief overview of working of t-SNE:

The algorithms starts by calculating the probability of similarity of points in high-dimensional space and calculating the probability of similarity of points in the corresponding low-dimensional space. The similarity of points is calculated as the conditional probability that a point A would choose point B as its neighbor if neighbors were picked in proportion to their probability density under a Gaussian (normal distribution) centered at A.
It then tries to minimize the difference between these conditional probabilities (or similarities) in higher-dimensional and lower-dimensional space for a perfect representation of data points in lower-dimensional space.
To measure the minimization of the sum of difference of conditional probability t-SNE minimizes the sum of Kullback-Leibler divergence of overall data points using a gradient descent method.
